Non OCaml dependencies
======================

Since this is a binding to L-BFGS-B, you need to

- download the tarball
    http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/Software/Lbfgsb.2.1.tar.gz
  or
    http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/Software/Lbfgsb.3.0.tar.gz
  and unpack it in src/ (it will create a subdirectory Lbfgsb.*);

- have a fortran compiler (gfortran recommended).
