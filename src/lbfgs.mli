type work
(** Represent the memory space needed to solve a minimization problem.
    It is usually allocated automatically but it is possible to
    do it manually to, say, allocate it once only before a loop. *)

exception Abnormal of float * string
(** [Abnormal(f, msg)] is raised if the routine terminated abnormally
    without being able to satisfy the termination conditions.  In such
    an event, the variable [x] (see {!F.min}) will contain the current
    best approximation found and [f] is the value of the target
    function at [x].  [msg] is a message containing additional
    information (returned by the original FORTRAN code).

    If the error message is not precise enough, it is recommended to
    turn printing on to understand what is the problem. *)

(** Control of the frequency at which information is outputted. *)
type print =
| No    (** No output is generated. *)
| Last  (** Print one line at the last iteration. *)
| Every of int (** [Every k] prints the value of the function and |proj
                   gradient| every [k] iterations.  Valid values are
                   [0 <= k <= 98], otherwise the closer value in that
                   interval is used. *)
| Details (** Print details of every iteration (except vectors). *)
| All   (** Print details of every iteration (except vectors)
            including changes of active set and final x.  *)
| Full  (** Print details of every iteration including x and g. *)

type state
(** Holds informations on the current state of the computation that
    can help to decide whether to stop. *)

  (** [min f_df x] compute the minimum of the function [f] given by
    [f_df].  [x] is an initial estimate of the solution vector.  On
    termination, [x] will contain the best approximation found.  [f_df
    x df] is a function that computes f(x) and its gradiant f'(x),
    returns f(x) and stores f'(x) in [df].  The [x] passed to [f_df x
    df] is physically equal to the [x] given in [min f_df x].  Can
    raise {!Abnormal}.

    @param l lower bound for each component of the vector [x].  Set
    [l.(i)] to [neg_infinity] to indicate that no lower bound is desired.
    Default: no lower bounds.

    @param u upper bound for each component of the vector [x].  Set
    [u.(i)] to [infinity] to indicate that no upper bound is desired.
    Default: no upper bounds.

    @param n the dimension of the space of unknowns.
    Default: [dim x - ofsx + 1].
    @param ofsl offset for the matrix [l].  Default: [1].
    @param ofsu offset for the matrix [u].  Default: [1].
    @param ofsx offset for the matrix [x].  Default: [1].

    @param factr tolerance in the termination test for the algorithm.
    The iteration will stop when
    [(f^k - f^{k+1})/max{|f^k|,|f^{k+1}|,1} <= factr*epsilon_float].
    Set e.g. [factr] to [1e12] for low accuracy, [1e7] for moderate
    accuracy and [1e1] for extremely high accuracy.  Setting [factr] to
    [0.] suppresses this termination test.  Default: [1e7].

    @param pgtol The iteration will stop when
    [max{|proj g_i| : i = 1,..., n} <= pgtol]
    where [proj g_i] is the ith component of the projected gradient.
    Setting [pgtol] to [0.] suppresses this termination test.
    Default: [1e-5].

    @param corrections maximum number of variable metric corrections
    used to define the limited memory matrix.  Values < 3 are not
    recommended, and large values of [corrections] can result in
    excessive computing time.  The range 3 <= [corrections] <= 20 is
    recommended.  Default: [10].

    @param nsteps maximum number of steps.  Default: no limitation.

    @param stop a function that tells whether we stop the computation
    after at the current approximation.

    @param print Tells the amount of debugging information desired.
    Default: [No]. *)
